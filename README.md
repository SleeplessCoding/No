This application includes two methods, computeAverageSales() and computeShippingCharges().

The computeAverageSales() method is going to be an average calculator for sales where the user inputs amounts and then essentially hits done and the calculator will average out the sales. This method will use sentinel controlled repetition as well as notify the user for averages of significant sale.
The computeShippingCharges() method will calculate the total of user input shipping charges for an order. This method will use sentinel controlled repetition and will give its result as a double.
We will then call these methods and prove that they function within our program.

Pseudocode:

START {

Create computeAverageSales() 

{

Define methodâ€™s needed variables

totalPrice;

itemPrice;

averageSales;

itemsCount;

Ask user for item price?

itemPrice + totalPrice = totalPrice

add 1 to count, itemCount + 1

ask if there is another item

if YES, loop back to (ask user for item price?)

if NO, averageSales = totalPrice / itemsCount

} 

Create computeShippingCost()

{

Define methods needed variables

itemShippingCost;

totalShippingCost;

ask user to enter the shipping charge for item ?

totalShippingCost = totalShippingCost + itemShippingCost

ask if there is another shipping charge?

If YES, loop back to (ask user to enter the shipping charge for item?)

If NO,

}

} END

main START {

In main we will define variables to use for method calls and to display to user

totalShippingCost;

totalAverageSales;

we will use the methods computeAverageSales() and computeShippingCost()

if averageSales is more than $200 than we will display a message

we confirm total cost and shipping cost to user

} main END
